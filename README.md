This project aims to optimize the engagement rates of an email marketing campaign by comparing two different versions of an email, labeled Version A and Version B. The objective is to determine which version yields a higher click-through rate (CTR) and to make data-driven decisions to enhance future email marketing strategies. The analysis will be conducted using the R programming language.

Dataset:
The dataset, email_campaign.csv, consists of 1,000 records and includes the following columns:

Recipient_ID: A unique identifier for each email recipient.
Email_Version: Indicates whether the recipient received Version A or Version B of the email.
Click_Through_Rate: Indicates whether the recipient clicked on a link within the email (1 for click, 0 for no click).
Steps:

Data Collection and Loading:
The dataset is loaded into R for analysis. Initial data exploration checks for missing values, outliers, and data consistency.

Hypothesis Formulation:

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in click-through rates between Version A and Version B.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Version B has a higher click-through rate than Version A.
Data Preprocessing:
Randomly divide the recipients into two groups ensuring comparability in terms of key characteristics.

Calculation of Click-Through Rates:
Calculate the click-through rates for both versions.

Statistical Testing:
Perform a chi-squared test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in click-through rates between the two email versions.

Results Interpretation:
Analyze the p-value from the chi-squared test. A p-value below 0.05 indicates a significant difference, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis.

Visualization:
Create bar plots to visually compare the click-through rates of the two email versions.

Conclusion and Recommendations:
Summarize the findings and provide actionable recommendations based on the results. If Version B performs better, it should be implemented in future email campaigns.

Documentation:
Compile a comprehensive report including all steps, code snippets, statistical results, and visualizations for stakeholders.

Through this approach we can ensure a thorough analysis, helping to make informed decisions and improve the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns.
